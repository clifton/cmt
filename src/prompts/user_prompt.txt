Generate a professional commit message for this diff:

```diff
{{changes}}
```

Instructions:
1. If pre-analysis was provided above, use it to help select the commit type
2. ALWAYS verify by reading the actual diff - the analysis is a hint, not a rule
3. Focus on the PRIMARY purpose of the change (what problem does it solve?)
4. For the subject line: be specific, use present tense, max 50 chars
5. For details: explain WHY, not just WHAT changed

Remember the type priority hierarchy:
fix > feat > perf > refactor > test > build > ci > chore > style > docs

A one-line bug fix with extensive docs = "fix", not "docs"
